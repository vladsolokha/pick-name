generate react app
design

using 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-react-frontend-a-node-express-backend-and-connect-them-together-c5798926047c/
by the way

generate express api
npm install in the api folder
set to different port to test in bin/www

create new api route in js in /routes

in main app.js create app.use
similar to react component

create var to get from new api route
which sends info down to app.use

npm start (in api folder)
go to port then in address type /<new api route name>

going to stop at 'fetching API with react'
maybe there's a hook foor connecting api to react app?

deploy using beanstalk
