using

by the way

generate express api
npm install in the api folder
set to different port to test in bin/www

create new api route in js in /routes

in main app.js create app.use
similar to react component

create var to get from new api route
which sends info down to app.use

npm start (in api folder)
go to port then in address type /<new api route name>

going to stop at 'fetching API with react'
maybe there's a hook foor connecting api to react app?

deploy using beanstalk

React frontend, Express server, MongoDB database, Node backend

React has hooks to manage state - use reducer hook to manage state of students
get students from database using API calls from front {% endautoescape %}

frontend calls server using REST API -> server calls database using fetch?

After front end is ready, develop CRUD backend using GraphQL 
implement into AWS using docker compose
